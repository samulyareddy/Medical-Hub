# AI Medical Triage Hub

An intelligent healthcare support platform that streamlines patient-doctor interactions using AI-powered triage and real-time chat.

## Features

- **AI Triage & Analysis**: Automatically analyzes patient tickets to estimate urgency and suggest relevant specialists.

- **Clinical Reports(SOAP)**: Generates professional medical summaries for admins and doctors using the SOAP format:
  - **Subjective (S)**: Patient's complaints, history, and reported symptoms.
  - **Objective (O)**: Direct observations, including photos or exam findings.
  - **Assessment (A)**: Professional AI analysis and likely diagnosis.
  - **Plan (P)**: Recommended treatment, tests ordered, and follow-up advice.

- **Real-time Chat**: Integrated messaging between patients and doctors using **Socket.io**

- **Smart Routing**: Directs tickets to the appropriate personnel based on AI analysis.

- **Agentic RAG Chatbot**: A state-of-art medical assistant powered by **LangGraph**.
  - **Real-time Streaming**: Uses `astream_events` (v2) to provide a fluid, token-by-token chat experience for patients.
  - **Thread-Based Persistence**: Leverages an **Async SQL Checkpointer** (SQLite) to automatically save and resume conversation states across sessions.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: The persistence layer ensures that even if the server restarts or crashes, the agentic workflow can resume execution from the exact last checkpoint without losing state progress.
  - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Maintains granular conversation context within a thread, allowing the agent to remember medical queries and previous advice in real-time.

## Authentication

This project uses a **Stateless Authentication** mechanism secured by **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.

### How it works:

1.  **Login**: Users (Patients, Doctors, Admins) authenticate via `/auth/login`.
2.  **Token Generation**: Upon successful validation, the server generates a JWT containing:
    - `sub`: User email
    - `role`: User role (patient, doctor, admin)
    - `id`: User ID
3.  **Storage**: The JWT is sent to the client and stored in an **HTTPOnly Cookie** named `access_token`. This prevents client-side access.
4.  **Verification**: Protected routes use the `get_current_user` dependency to read the cookie, decode the token, and verify the user session.
