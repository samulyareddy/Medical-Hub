# AI Medical Hub

An intelligent healthcare support platform that streamlines patient-doctor interactions using AI-powered triage and real-time chat.

## Features

- **AI Analysis**: Automatically analyzes patient tickets to estimate urgency and suggest relevant specialists.

- **Clinical Reports(SOAP)**: Generates professional medical summaries for admins and doctors using the SOAP format:
  - **Subjective (S)**: Patient's complaints, history, and reported symptoms.
  - **Objective (O)**: Direct observations, including photos or exam findings.
  - **Assessment (A)**: Professional AI analysis and likely diagnosis.
  - **Plan (P)**: Recommended treatment, tests ordered, and follow-up advice.

- **Real-time Chat**: Integrated messaging between patients and doctors using **Socket.io**

- **Smart Routing**: Directs tickets to the appropriate personnel based on AI analysis.

- **Agentic Chatbots (Dual Agents)**: State-of-the-art medical assistants powered by **LangGraph**, tailored to user roles:
  - **Patient Agent**: Provides personalized medical assistance and symptom checking for patients.
  - **Doctor Agent**: A specialized assistant for doctors equipped with tools to:
    - Find actionable/closable tickets (Smart Close)
    - Autonomously generate clinical reports (SOAP)
    - Resolve tickets directly via chat commands
  - **Real-time Streaming**: Uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to provide token-by-token chat experience.
  - **Thread-Based Persistence**: Uses LangGraph's **MongoDBSaver** checkpointer to automatically save and resume conversation states across sessions, securely mapped to individual users.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: The persistence layer ensures that even if the server restarts or crashes, the agentic workflow can resume execution from the exact last checkpoint without losing state progress.
  - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Maintains granular conversation context within a thread, allowing agents to remember medical queries and previous instructions in real-time.
